                    <h2>Morning Coffee</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every day the young woman sees the old woman selling roses. In the morning the old woman stands by the brownstones across
                        the street, but in the afternoon she is gone. Occasionally the young woman sees someone stop to buy
                        a rose. She wonders if the old woman ever thinks to ask who the rose is for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, when the young woman needs her, the old woman isn’t there. The young woman buys her coffee and walks to the cemetery
                        with no gift. Not that it matters. He never bought her roses. He never brought her gifts, or sent
                        a Christmas card, or even called.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When she was younger she thought he did. She got a doll, some shoes, a dress, and some earrings. She never knew all her mother
                        did for her, until she got older and realized she had only seen his pictures and had never heard
                        his voice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center">***</p>
                    <p>
                        Years later, she got a call from him on a sunny morning. She almost didn’t go to the coffee shop the next day. She did, though.
                        She sat down and didn’t say “hello,” until he said “hi.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He reached to pay the whole bill, but she said “I can pay for myself.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just as she stood to leave, he said “I have three months.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “What?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Terminal cancer. The doctors can’t do anything.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She sat down for another coffee. This time she let him get the bill.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center">***</p>
                    <p>
                        For two months and a week she got coffee with a stranger every morning. He told her about traveling in the south in his younger
                        days and about how late in life he ended up in a boring office job. She told him about being a teacher.
                        She didn’t tell him when her cat died the night before. He asked if she had been crying, and she
                        said “No.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She had many questions for him, but she was too afraid to ask them. She did one day, but she didn’t like the answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I was young and stupid.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He tried to reach for her hand, but she didn’t let him. She stood and left money for her coffee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She didn’t go to the coffee shop for three mornings, but on the fourth morning he was there waiting for her. They sipped
                        coffee in silence for a while. She told him about her new cat, but not about the man she went out
                        with that Friday night.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center">***</p>
                    <p>
                        Three days ago she got a call from another stranger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “He didn’t wake up this morning,” he said.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center">***</p>
                    <p>
                        She missed the funeral.
                    </p>
                    <p class="center">***</p>
                    <p>
                        This morning, for the first time she stops at his grave, but she doesn’t have a rose, just her coffee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She kisses her hand and touches the gravestone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Good bye,” she says.
                    </p>
